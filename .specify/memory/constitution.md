# Project Chimera Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Swarm-First Architecture
Every feature must be implemented using the FastRender Swarm pattern. Logic must be distributed between a Planner (Strategy), Worker (Execution), and Judge (Validation). No monolithic scripts.

### II. MCP-Native Connectivity
All external integrations (Twitter, Coinbase, Web) must be handled through the Model Context Protocol. This ensures tool portability and standardized discovery.

### III. True TDD (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests must be written before implementation. Every feature requires at least one failing test in the CI/CD pipeline before code is merged. Red-Green-Refactor is the law.

### IV. Linguistic DNA Integrity
All autonomous content must pass a Linguistic DNA check against `specs/SOUL.md`. Hallucinations or departures from character are considered critical failures.

### V. Financial Safety (Guardrails)
No agent is permitted to execute on-chain actions without a signed intent from a Planner and approval from a Judge. Daily USD limits must be strictly enforced.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other documentation. Amendments require alignment with the Super-Orchestrator goal. Use `specs/SOUL.md` for runtime identity guidance.
