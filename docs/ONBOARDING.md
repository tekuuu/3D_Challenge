# New contributor onboarding (first tasks)

1. Fork & clone the repo. Set `PYTHONPATH=$PWD` and create a venv.
2. Run `make setup`.
3. Run `pytest -q` and observe failing tests (this demonstrates TDD and missing integrations).
4. Read `specs/openclaw_integration.md` and `docs/DB_SCHEMA.md`.
5. Pick a small issue (label: good-first-issue) and implement a fix with tests.
