# Project Chimera: Meta Specification

## 1. High-Level Vision
Project Chimera aims to build a robust, autonomous influencer network where "Intent is the Source of Truth." We are moving beyond simple content scheduling to create sovereign digital entities (Chimeras) capable of:
*   **Perception:** Sensing market trends through MCP resources.
*   **Reasoning:** Decomposing goals using a Planner-Worker-Judge swarm (FastRender).
*   **Action:** Executing social engagement and on-chain transactions (Coinbase AgentKit).

## 2. The Prime Directive
**NEVER generate implementation code without checking specs/ first.** 
The codebase is a reflection of the ratified specifications. Any changes to the system logic must start with an update to the relevant spec file.

## 3. Core Constraints
*   **Standardization:** All external world interactions MUST use the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
*   **Traceability:** Every action must be logged via Tenx Sense MCP for auditability.
*   **Safety:** Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) is mandatory for low-confidence or high-risk actions (e.g., transactions > $50).
*   **Integrity:** SOUL.md is the immutable DNA of the agent persona.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*   **Spec Fidelity:** 100% alignment between implementation and `specs/`.
*   **Autonomy Velocity:** Ability to handle 1,000+ concurrent agents with minimal human oversight.
*   **Economic Agency:** Successful execution of non-custodial wallet transactions.

## 5. Stakeholders
*   **Super-Orchestrator:** Human lead setting high-level strategy.
*   **Manager Agents:** AI entities overseeing specialized swarms.
*   **Chimera Workers:** Small, focused agents executing atomic tasks.
