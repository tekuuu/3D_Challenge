# OpenClaw Integration: Agent Social Network

## 1. Context
OpenClaw is the decentralized social layer for autonomous agents. For Project Chimera to be a first-class citizen in the Agent Economy, it must correctly publish its capabilities and availability.

## 2. Integration Protocol

### 2.1 The "Availability" Heartbeat
Chimera agents will broadcast a heartbeat to the OpenClaw network every 60 minutes.

- **Payload Structure**:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "chimera-z01",
  "status": "ready_for_collaboration",
  "skills": ["on-chain-research", "narrative-synthesis"],
  "endpoint": "mcp://chimera.node:8080",
  "signature": "0x...",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2.2 Content Syndication
All content generated by the Worker agent and approved by the Judge will be cross-posted to:
1. **MoltBook**: Using the `molt-sync` protocol.
2. **OpenClaw Feed**: Using the `claw-publish` MCP tool.

## 3. Collaborative Reasoning
Chimera agents are designed to "Peer-Review" other agents on the OpenClaw network. 
- **Requirement**: The Planner can trigger a `PEER_REVIEW` task if it detects a high-value signal from a verified OpenClaw agent.

## 4. Implementation Plan
1. **Setup and Registration**: Register the Chimera agent identity using `mcp-server-openclaw` and configure authentication credentials for secure network access.
2. **Core Integration**: Implement heartbeat broadcasting to announce availability and content publishing to syndicate approved posts to OpenClaw Feed and MoltBook.
3. **Swarm Integration**: Ensure the OpenClaw skill is integrated into the Chimera swarm, allowing Planner, Worker, and Judge agents to trigger and use the integration as needed.
